                <li class="mb-1">Unless otherwise agreed with your account manager, and subject to earlier termination in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, the Term is, for an initial minimum, a 12-month period (the “Initial Term”). The Initial Term will start on the Start Date (the day when you start using the Service or the Free Service) and expire on the End Date (the day corresponding the date in the month in which the initial service term expires). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, the Agreement will continue automatically unless and until either party gives the other 30 days’ written notice or either You or We otherwise terminate the Agreement in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</li>
                <li class="mb-1">If at any time You wish to terminate the Agreement, You must either:

                        <li class="mb-1">Give Us no less than 30 days’ written notice, such notice will take effect no sooner than the End Date (subject to any variation thereof). If You wish to terminate the Agreement with effect from any date preceding such End Date and are unable to do so for cause or any other reason under these Terms and Conditions, if you are a Customer under the Agreement then You must pay Us the Customer Charges due for each month (or part thereof) remaining of the minimum 12-month period post-termination. Such Customer Charges will be calculated on the basis of the monthly Customer Charges as set out in the Signature Page (as varied if applicable), and any prepayment of Customer Charges that You have made to Us will not be credited or refunded (“No refund, exchange only”). The latter shall not prevent any refund to be made according to the applicable customer protection laws.</li>

                </li>
                <li class="mb-1">Either party may also terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by notice to the other party if:
